TODO Communications
-Create Base Class
    -Instance of connected Device?
    -Find -> initiate scan to return list of available devices that comply with given conditions (TAG in name)
    -Connect -> initiate connecting to device of scan list (may include password)
    -Disconnect
    -Send -> send byte array (String) to connected device
    -Receive Callback -> received byte array from device to be executed by external code

-Create BT class as base class but bluetooth specific

-Start of protocol implementation to be done after connecting // should we do this as extra class? since we would reuse it for others comm types
                                                                  we need to differentiate for update information and build information, so maybe in main or modules?
    -Handshake as simple as: (in case one of these steps get no response, fail to connect "library not installed on device"
        -Phone to uC: code for "hey im the app that does the interface do you have the needed library"
        -uC to Phone: code for "yes i do, it's on version blabla"
        -Phone to uC: code for "nice to meet you, would you mind sending me the information for the interface"
        -uC to Phone: sends information with some sort of build done message at the end
        -Phone to uC: code for "ok im ready you can start updating the information now, don't forget to do it once for all modules at the beginning"
